# ☎️ Phonebook "Filter by Age" App - Next.js 13 + React 18 + Tailwind CSS + XState + CRUD Operations

# 👀 View Production Build at https://phonebook-filter-by-age.vercel.app/

This is a simple phonebook app that supports CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) and "filter by age" functionality.

The app provides a form where you can enter a name, birthday, mailing address,phone number, and email for each phonebook entry.

Below you will find the complete feature set, a discussion section, and my technical journal.

## Tech Stack

1. ✅ Next.js 13
1. ✅ React 18
1. ✅ Tailwind CSS
1. ✅ TypeScript
1. ✅ XState finite state machines
1. ✅ `localStorage` used as database
1. ✅ Vercel for deployment
1. ✅ TravisCI for CI/CD
1. ✅ Jest + React Testing Library
1. ✅ ESLint + Prettier + Husky Git Hooks

## Feature List

### ✅ === DONE

### 🌠 === TODO

1. ✅ Used Next.js version 13.0.3 with React 18.2.0 and Tailwind CSS 3.2.4.
1. ✅ Deployed Next.js production build to Vercel with CI/CD at Travis CI.
1. ✅ Established engineering best practices:
   - Prettier, ESLint, Husky (Git Hooks), `tsconfig.json`, TypeScript Import Sorter, XState
1. ✅ Implemented XState finite state machine to handle application state.
1. ✅ Built accessible dialog (modal) using Headless UI and Tailwind CSS.
1. ✅ Added various tooltips that appear on hover to improve user experience.
1. ✅ Enabled CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, and RESET actions using React Hook Form.
1. ✅ Sorted data by last name for a consistent user experience in the app.
1. 🌠 Matched design document with READ and search by last name functionality.
1. 🌠 Add unit test coverage for entire app with Jest & React Testing Library.

## Discussion Section

1. 🌠 XState takes the place of React Query in the app. The benefit of XState is the finite set of states, without additional testing.
2. 🌠 It would be easy to connect any database without affecting the frontend by simplying replacing the `localStorage` calls in XState.
3. 🌠 The app isn't particularly well-suited to GraphQL given the CRUD model, simplistic data objects, and extremely small data size.
4. 🌠 We don't handle phone validation at all, but we would probably want some type of validation in production, as long as it's reliable.
5. 🌠 The entire codebase could use extensive refactoring, since everything is simply built in the homepage (`@/pages/index.tsx`).
6. 🌠 The app is difficult to test with React Testing Library without refactoring, because everything is closely coupled with XState.
7. 🌠 Docker is unnecessary for this project, and I find it almost always reduces the performance of Next.js vs. deploying at Vercel.
8. 🌠 Material UI has some benefits, but it can be hard to customize unless the designer uses it, while Tailwind is very easy to use.
   - See [https://github.com/DoctorDerek/calendar-appointments](https://github.com/DoctorDerek/calendar-appointments) for an example from my portfolio using Material UI in depth.
9. 🌠 Like with many projects, the design document left out certain features: RESET, dialogs (modals), hover styles, and animations.
10. 🌠 Because of the combination of `localStorage` with XState, we have auto-save functionality that supports refreshing the page.
11. 🌠 "Consider how interactions might occur on a touch screen vs standard keyboard / mouse"
12. 🌠 "Consider best practices in regard to accessibility."
13. 🌠 "We have comps for mobile and desktop, but the list needs to look good at any width. We'll leave the details of the in-between views up to you."
